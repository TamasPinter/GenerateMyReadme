## Description
This is a ReadMe Generator I created which runs through Node. Through creating this project I found a great way to automatically create and format an important part to every repo. I learned a lot about using various native and non-native Node libraries. By using this script, I can create a very nice looking ReadMe file to use in every situation.

## Installation
Once you have a clone of the repo, open the internal terminal of VS code and run npm install. This will install the inquirer library which you will need.

## Usage
Once inquirer is installed, through the terminal again, run 'node index.js'. Now you will be asked questions in regards to your ReadMe file. Follow along and answer as best as you can. The Test section only requires your GitHub name, the link will appear by default.
